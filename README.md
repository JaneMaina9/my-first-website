# my-first-website Trial
This is my very first website!  As someone without a background in software engineering, I’ve poured my heart into learning web development, and I’m really proud of how it turned out. It’s a simple yet sleek portfolio to showcase my work as a Web3 Developer and Blockchain trainer. The design is modern, responsive, and features everything from my Home and Resume to my Projects and Contact details. It’s a journey I’m just starting, and I know I’ll only keep improving from here!
i'll definitly do better.
LFG!!.
